# Demo E-Commerce Store

This project was intended to consolidate learning across several topics in JS & React, namely useState, useEffect, styled-components, react-router and fetch. 

It uses the Platzi Fake Store API to siumulate a range of products and has functionality to add and remove items from a basket, as well as 'checkout' those items by emptying the basket.
